# rusty-markov
Learning Rust with a [markov-chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) text generator.

Try it:
```sh
cargo run <corpus-examples/moby-dick.txt

> **Note:** The implementation in this project is likely _not_ to follow academic discussion of algorithms in natural language processing. I'm deliberately not researching the subject as a fun exercise to explore the concept on my own. Sometimes it's fun to take on a project like this, starting from a place of ignorance, and seeing where it takes you.
